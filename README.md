To edit this website create new posts in the `content/post` folder along with
an image to be used as the thumbnail in `static/images`.

The formatting of posts is in markdown. Look up how to use markdown
[here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

To make new pages such as `/about`. Create an `about.md` inside `content`.

You can edit the sidebar by putting a file in `data/menu.yml` like they do in
the example here `themes/newsroom/exampleSite/data/menu.yml`.
